# blah-machine

The "Blah" Machine is a drum machine I built using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The "Blah" comes from __Blahvocado__, the moniker I have previously used to write and produce songs under.

The samples in each of the two banks - _Hold My Soul_ and _Nervepool_ - are ripped from two songs I have written by the same names.
